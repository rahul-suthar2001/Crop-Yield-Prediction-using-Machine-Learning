Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. 
Here, I present you a dataset which would allow the users to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops 
to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

The science of training machines to learn and produce models for future predictions is widely used,
and not for nothing. Agriculture plays a critical role in the global economy. With the continuing expansion 
of the human population understanding worldwide crop yield is central to addressing food security challenges and 
reducing the impacts of climate change.

Crop yield prediction is an important agricultural problem. The Agricultural yield primarily depends on weather conditions
(rain, temperature, etc), pesticides and accurate information about history of crop yield is an important thing for making decisions 
related to agricultural risk management and future predictions.


## TO Run App
First run the jupyter notebook and then those model pickle file is move to app folder .
app is created using streamlit so to run streamlit use command
streamlit run {file_name}
